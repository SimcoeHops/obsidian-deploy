# Recipe: The Best Scones Recipe Ever

## Ingredients
- 3 cups (360g) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup (135g) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk (or your preferred milk alternative)
- 2/3 cup (160ml) vegetable oil (or melted butter)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups (225g) fresh or frozen fruit (e.g., blueberries, diced peaches, or substitute with orange extract—see below)

Be mindful of the salt situation - reduce the salt added by a wide margin if you’re using salted butter etc. 

Also along those same lines, don’t use crappy butter if you want excellent output. 
## Instructions
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners or grease lightly.
2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract until smooth.
4. **Combine Mixtures**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not overmix—lumps are okay!
5. **Add Fruit or Flavoring**: Gently fold in the fruit (if using). If substituting, use 1-2 teaspoons of orange extract instead of fruit.
6. **Portion Batter**: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.
7. **Bake**: Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
8. **Cool and Serve**: Allow muffins to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Substitution Notes
- If fresh fruit is unavailable, use frozen fruit directly from the freezer (no need to thaw).
- For a citrusy twist, replace fruit with 1-2 teaspoons of orange extract.

## Storage Tips
- **Room Temperature**: Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
- **Freezer**: Freeze muffins in a sealed bag or container for up to 3 months. Reheat before serving.
