# Recipe: Double-Batch Perfect Scones (yields 24)

This recipe yields about 4 discs of 6 scones each (24 scones total). It is a doubled recipe because I like to share. Half it if need be ... here's the halved version: [Jump to Regular Recipe (yields about 12 scones)](#regular-scones-recipe)
## Ingredients
- 5 1/2 cups (660g) all-purpose flour
- 2/3 cup (130g) sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt (reduce if using salted butter)
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 cup (2 sticks, 230g) cold butter (use high-quality for best results)
- 3 cups (360g) dried cranberries (or substitute with 1-2 teaspoons orange extract)
- Grated zest of 2 medium oranges (if not using orange extract)
- 4 large eggs
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 to 1 1/3 cups (240-320ml) heavy cream
- 4 teaspoons milk (for brushing tops)
- Coarse sugar (turbinado) for sprinkling

Be mindful that if you're using salted butter, you should reduce salt in the recipe. Also, use excellent quality butter if you're aiming for excellent quality output.

## Instructions
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: Combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Stir or whisk to mix thoroughly.
2. **Cut in Butter**: Using a pastry cutter or fork, cut the cold butter into the dry ingredients. The mixture should resemble coarse crumbs, with some small pea-sized bits of butter throughout.
3. **Add Fruit or Flavoring**: Mix in the dried cranberries and orange zest. If substituting, omit zest and stir in 1-2 teaspoons of orange extract instead.
4. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, 1 cup of heavy cream, and vanilla extract.
5. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures**: Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. If the dough seems too dry, add the remaining cream a little at a time until the dough is sticky but easily leaves the sides of the bowl.
6. **Shape the Dough**: Line a baking tray with parchment paper and lightly dust it with flour. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Flatten each portion into a disk about 6 inches in diameter and 1+ inches thick.
7. **Cut into Wedges**: With a wet knife, cut each disk into six wedges. Pull the wedges apart slightly, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between them.
8. **Chill**: Brush the tops of the scones with a bit of cream and sprinkle with coarse sugar. Place the trays in the freezer for 30 minutes. (Use multiple trays if necessary to fit your freezer space.)
9. **Preheat Oven**: While the scones chill, preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).
10. **Bake**: Remove the scones from the freezer and bake directly in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.
11. **Cool and Serve**: Let the scones cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.
